This year is one of the best year in my life. I got to significantly improved myself in many aspects. Some of the things I learned:

## 1. Discipline

I've been very consistent in my life. I tidied up my schedule. 

## 2. Stable

The opposite of being fluctuative. I have a very stable emotions and mind right now, doesn't really influenced by external factors. Stoic at its peak.

## 3. Better Time Management

Since 2021 my time management has improved a lot, but in the late 2025 is better because I can actually control the urge to play Valorant (no longer having dopamine surge). I write in this blog at least once a day.

## 4. Improved Social Life

I spent a significantly more time to socialize. I met a lot of new people, joined new communities, actively volunteering in events. Last year was worse, I don't really know how to be social.

My public speaking skill is also better than few months ago. I can speak in front of everyone without hassle, anxiety, and trembling. But I still need to process my thoughts more efficiently so that I can restructure my own thoughts into a better formulated sentences.
