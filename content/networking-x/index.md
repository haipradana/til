I was volunteering in an event called IDSW today. Everyone here mostly use X as their main social networking platform. I feel like Facebook techbros and X techbros are in two different worlds. Different circle, different trends, different behavior.

To get into a techbro circle in Facebook is easy, we can just join a group we want (e.g. React Indonesia, Nodejs Indonesia, IMPHNEN), contribute to the group, and adding more people. In X, we can just reply to someone's thread, follow, and give more engagement to people to be noticed. X is easier in terms of getting relations, because engagement is everything. 

Someone gave me tips about how to tweet on X properly, to avoid hate and heat:

1. Post something positive
2. If you hate something, don't hate the person, hate the idea
3. You can post anything I want, even the smallest idea
4. Engagement is everything
5. Try to reply to someone's tweet more often to get noticed
6. Don't be denial if you post something and someone critics you for being wrong, just acknowledge it and give a positive feedback

In X techbros circle, when they were gathered in IDSW, I feel like everyone knows everyone. I saw them greeting each other like friends that haven't meet for a long time even though it's actually the first time they met. They've known each other on X.
